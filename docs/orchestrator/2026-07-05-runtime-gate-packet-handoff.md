workstream: W5 Heureka customer/admin row-level cabinet proof

## Intent Preservation Chain

Vision -> Every sellable order is error-free and every buyer/admin surface reflects canonical Orders lifecycle.

Goal Impact -> Heureka source/runtime-presence proof is recorded; row-level lifecycle proof requires approved customer/admin session and non-stale central Orders row criteria.

System -> Orders owns canonical lifecycle and read model. Heureka owns channel dashboard/admin rendering and may only prove row-level state with approved session and redacted evidence.

Feature -> Heureka row-level marketplace cabinet proof packet boundary.

Task -> Consume the Orders marketplace row-level packet contract and keep live row-level proof auth/session gated.

Execution Plan -> Treat Orders commit 1d0ff06 as the source of truth for runtime gate packet shape; keep this repo source-only until the required non-secret packet exists; preserve missing facts as [MISSING: ...] or [UNKNOWN: ...].

Coding Prompt -> Remote-only Alfares workflow. Do not deploy, mutate orders, mutate Warehouse stock/fulfillment, call providers, print tokens, print raw customer/order/payment/provider/tracking data, print raw DB rows, or capture screenshots from this handoff.

Code -> Documentation handoff only. Runtime implementation/smoke remains gated.

Validation -> git diff --check; npm run verify:orders-lifecycle-ui; Orders npm run verify:runtime-gate-packets at commit 1d0ff06.

## Required Packet

Packet section: W3-W5 Marketplace Row-Level Cabinet Packet in Orders runtime gate packet contract.

Required non-secret fields before runtime proof:

- [MISSING: approved live Heureka customer/admin bearer or browser session packet for row-level dashboard/admin smoke]
- [MISSING: approved row-level proof that at least one Heureka dashboard/admin response renders a current non-stale canonical Orders lifecycle stage]
- [UNKNOWN: whether current production data contains Heureka rows with central lifecycle status available]
- Target row criteria, expected lifecycle stage, freshness threshold, stale-row policy.
- Admin stats readback boundary.

## Abort Conditions

- No approved session exists.
- No non-stale central Orders row is available.
- Only anonymous/public shell routes are available.
- Proof would expose raw customer/order data.

## Current Decision

This repo is aligned to the central Orders runtime packet contract, but this handoff does not authorize live mutation, provider calls, deploys, DB writes, bearer/session capture, token output, raw payload output, or screenshots. Runtime proof remains blocked until the required packet is supplied and validated.
